# LOL coinz

A simple game based on taking away coins.

The game is written LOLCODE.
To run it you need to download and install lci

## rules

You take away 1,2 or 3 coins in your turn, if you take the last you lose.

Don't worry: it is possible to win against the com, so have fun playing.

## tips and spoilers

For more fun when you are playing correctly to win the com's turns are somewhat randomized.
I took the `rand()` implementation from Logan Kelly's LOLTracer which is under GPL v2.

You wouldn't be able to win if the com would take the first coins.
